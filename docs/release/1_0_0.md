## v. 1.0.0

*January 15, 2020*
This is a massive update! First we merged the UI of the M2M Wallet with the LPWAN Server, making the entire system mobile friendly. Then we modified Top-Up to ensure that you can only top up your MXC if you paired your wallet with your supernode account. We also improved the staking experience so that you're able to unstake and restake your MXC.

Naturally we fixed a number of bugs along the way, including:

* Issues with users seeing incorrect staking or balance numbers
* New organizations can now be added to the organization list
* Fixed missing or incorrect translations
* Fixed inconsistencies between admin settings and what users see
* Many, many more bugs

### Upcoming Features

We're improving LPWAN device management and adding MQTT connectivity so that device owners can easily connect their data with a visualization platform.

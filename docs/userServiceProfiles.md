The Service Profile can be seen as the “contract” between an user and the network. It describes the features that are enabled for the user(s) of the Service Profile and the rate of messages that can be sent over the network.

When creating a Service Profile, the supernode will create the actual profile on the selected Network Server, and will keep a reference record so it knows to which organization it belongs.

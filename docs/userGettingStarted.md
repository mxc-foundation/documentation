MXC Supernodes provide LPWAN gateway and device management, and MXC token management using the M2M Wallet. Supernodes are an integral part of the MXC Ecosystem, connecting LPWAN hardware with blockchain. 

## Do you need a supernode account? 
Yes. That is, if you ever plan to participate in MXC Staking, you'll need an account with the MXC Supernode you wish to stake your MXC in. We are currently supporting the following supernodes:

* [MatchX Supernode (Germany)](https://supernode.matchx.io)
* [Huawei Tech Supernode (China)](https://www.hunanhuaweikeji.com)
* [Enlink Supernode (Korea)](https://lora.rosanetworks.com)

## Organization Structure
When creating a new user through the "Register" option, you are also creating a new organization. Organizations are designed to be functional for multiple users managing LPWAN devices for an organization or compamy. For this puprose, each organization has one M2M Wallet used for all of it's devices. Organizations can:
* Manage device profiles and devices
* Manage gateways
* Manage applications
* Manage users assigned to this organization

### User Types
Each organization is configured with two user types:

#### Organization Administrator 
An organization administrator is authorized to manage the users assigned with the organization and manage the gateways, applications and nodes of the gateway.

#### Regular User
Regular users are able to see all data, but are not able to make any modifications.

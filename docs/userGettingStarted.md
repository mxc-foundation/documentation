MXC Supernodes provide LPWAN gateway and device management, and MXC token management using the M2M Wallet. Supernodes are an integral part of the MXC Ecosystem, connecting LPWAN hardware with blockchain. 

## Do you need a supernode account? 
Yes. That is, if you ever plan to participate in MXC Staking, you'll need an account with the MXC Supernode you wish to stake your MXC in. We are currently supporting the following supernodes:

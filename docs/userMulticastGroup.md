By creating a multicast-group, it is possible to send a single downlink payload to a group of devices (the multicast-group). All these devices share the same multicast-address, session-keys and frame-counter.

After creating a multicast-group, it is possible to assign devices to the group. Please note that the device must already created (see Devices). Only devices that share the same Service Profile as the multicast-group can be added.

## Provisioning of the device
The provisioning of the multicast-group on the device happens out-of-band. This means that after adding a device to a multicast-group, you must also configure the device with the multicast-address, session-keys etcâ€¦

## Sending data
Sending data to the multicast-group happens using the gRPC or RESTful JSON API.

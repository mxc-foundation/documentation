Staking is a way to take a share of the profits generated by an MXC Supernode. 

## Supernode Profit Model
The current supernode profit model is as follows:
* 10% return to stakers
* 10% token burn
* 10% MXC Foundation
* 70% to the Supernode Operator

Therefore, by staking MXC, you receive a portion of the 10% dedicated to stakers. The amount you receive is directly related to the amount you staked, as well as the duration of the staking period.

## How to stake MXC
*Please note: before staking you need to have MXC in your M2M Wallet.*
1. Login to your supernode
2. Click on "Staking"
3. Enter the "Amount" of MXC you wish to stake
4. Click on "Confirm Stake"

## How to unstake MXC
Staking profits are calculated at the end of the current month. If you unstake early, you lose all potential staking profits for the current month. Therefore it is recommneded that you only unstake at the beginning of any given month. 
1. Navigate to "Staking"
2. Click on "Unstake"

Staking is a way to take a share of the profits generated by an MXC Supernode.

## Supernode Profit Model

The current supernode profit model is as follows:

- 10% return to stakers
- 10% token burn
- 10% MXC Foundation
- 70% to the Supernode Operator

Therefore, by staking MXC, you receive a portion of the 10% dedicated to stakers. The amount you receive is directly related to the amount you staked, as well as the duration of the staking period.

## How to stake MXC

_Please note: before staking you need to have MXC in your [DataDash App](https://mxc.wiki/docs/en/userStaking)_

1. Login to your Supernode with your DataDash App
2. Select "Stake"
3. Choose a "Plan" for staking
4- Enter the "Amount" of MXC or drag the amount bar to how much you wish to stake
5. Select "Confirm Stake"

## How to unstake MXC

Staking profits are calculated over a 30 days period. If you unstake early, you lose all potential staking profits for the current period. Therefore it is recommneded that you only unstake at the beginning of any given period.
The additional boosts are only available with plans Where your MXC can be locked for a given period, there is no unstake possible. 

1. Login to your Supernode with your DataDash App
2. Select "Wallet" in the menu bar
3. Select "Stake" tab at the top right
4. Select "Unstake" button
5. Choose the "Stake asset" to unstake
6. Enter 2FA token from Google Authenticator

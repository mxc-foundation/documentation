## v. 2.0.0
*March 19, 2020*

It has finally arrived! 2.0.0 integrates the Cobo Custody solution, making the MXC tokens held by our Supernode operators more secure than ever before.

This update brings an entirely new top-up system, making it easier to top-up by removing the need to register the wallet your are sending your MXC token from. 

With 2.0.0 we also released previews of upcoming features including our new MXC Supernode Dashboard, and the MXC Token Withdraw feature.

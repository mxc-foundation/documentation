You can manage your Supernode M2M Wallet in the [MXC DataDash app](http://onelink.to/ad4msa). Without this app it is impossible to top-up, stake or further manage the MXC used for transactions on a supernode.

## Where to Download the App

MXC DataDash is available in both the [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxc.smartcity) and [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/mxc-datadash/id1509218470). If you're unable to use these markets, you can also [download the apk directly from our site](https://www.mxc.org/app/).

*Please note: downloading the APK is less secure than using the app from the Google Play or iOS App stores.*

## How to Login to the App
When you first open the app, you will see a login screen.

1. Choose your supernode by clicking the + symbol in the circle. Each supernode is built for a different region.
1. Select the supernode you wish to login to
1. If you have an account, you can add your login credentials press "login", if not, you will need to follow the prompts to register for a new account.


## Topping-up your DataDash Wallet
DataDash top-ups are managed similarly to the average exchange top-up. From the app home screen:

## Withdrawing MXC from your DataDash Wallet

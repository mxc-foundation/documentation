You can manage your Supernode M2M Wallet in the MXC DataDash app. Without this app it is impossible to top-up, stake or further manage the MXC used for transactions on a supernode.

## Where to Download the App

MXC DataDash is available in both the Android Play Store and iOS App Store. If you're unable to use these markets, you can also download the apk directly from our site.

*Please note: downloading the SDK is less secure than using the app from the Google Play or iOS App stores.*





Your wallet balance includes the amount of available MXC topped-up to this specific supernode.\
*Please note: staked token is not included in your available balance.*

## Top-Up Your Wallet Balance
To top up your wallet, first login to your user account. 

1. Navigate to "M2M Wallet"
2. Click on "Top-up"
3. Send MXC to the wallet address provided

Congratulations! You've topped up your M2M Wallet

## Withdraw your Wallet Balance
Withdraw functionality is currently under development, and will be added within the next three months.

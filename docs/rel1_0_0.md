## v. 1.0.7

This release was a bug squashing marathon filled with bugs, that we successfully squashed. While squashing these bugs, we made it easier for us to squash more by improving the development environment. If you haven't already noticed, you're welcome to join the MXC Development team on [GitHub](https://github.com/mxc-foundation/lpwan-app-server). Issue hunters are always welcome. :) 

In this release, we squashed:
* Naming issues of different pages

* Pages that weren't visible in China
* Mobile compatibility issues
* Buttons that didn't work
* Back button errors (it didn't work so well)

## v. 1.0.0

*January 15, 2020*
This is a massive update! First we merged the UI of the M2M Wallet with the LPWAN Server, making the entire system mobile friendly. Then we modified Top-Up to ensure that you can only top up your MXC if you paired your wallet with your supernode account. We also improved the staking experience so that you're able to unstake and restake your MXC.

* New organizations can now be added to the organization list
* Fixed missing or incorrect translations
* Fixed inconsistencies between admin settings and what users see
* Many, many more bugs

### Some Known Issues

* When registering, if a duplicate organization name is used, the page doesnâ€™t load
